# Geoparsing Pliny the Elder's Natural History

* The **Geoparsing Pliny Natural History** is the first workpackage of my PhD project 'Greek Spaces in Roman Times' that aims at analyzing the geographic description of Greece in Pliny's encyclopedia. The scope of this package is to identify place names in the NH and disambiguate them by stable IDs.*
