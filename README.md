# Geoparsing Pliny the Elder's Natural History

* The **Geoparsing Pliny Natural History** is the first workpackage of my PhD project 'Greek Spaces in Roman Times' that aims at analyzing the geographic description of Greece in Pliny's encyclopedia. The scope of this package is to identify place names in the NH and disambiguate them by stable IDs through an external knowledge base.

## Usage

The repository contains the code to extract annotations from ToposText (https://topostext.org), an online repository of Classical texts in translation, perform flairNER and merge the annotations. Using VecAlign in combination of LABSE, SimAlign in combination with UGARIT-gr the pipeline allows to trasnfer the annotation from the English translation back to the Latin original text.
